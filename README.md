# DS-Vending-Machine
It was our mini project done in sem 3 of BE.It is written in C language
It basically takes the input from user in form of coins eg.1,5,2,10Rs
and displays the colddrinks along with the count whether its available and the transaction will go on till he exits and the counter decrements and
it does return change of coins as well
